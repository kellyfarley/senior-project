<h1 id="title"> THE WRITE IDEA </h1>

<p> Writing is so much more than spelling and comma usage. <strong> THE WRITE IDEA </strong> is a text editor that edits writing for style. </p>

 <p> Of course, all style suggestions are merely that: <strong> suggestions. </strong> Writing is just as much about intentionally breaking rules as it is about following them. </p>
