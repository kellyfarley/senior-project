<p id="weakVerbExplanation" class="hidden"> This verb is overused (though can sometimes be appropriate if trying to place emphasis on something other than the action). Consider consulting a thesaurus if that was not your intention. </p>

<p id="vagueNounExplanation" class="hidden"> This word is too generic - what exactly are you talking about? </p>

<p id="adverbExplanation" class="hidden"> In Mr. Cruz’s words, “Kill all adverbs.” Using an adverb usually means you’re using a weaker verb - try to change that verb to be more powerful. </p>

<p id="misusedExplanation" class="hidden"> This word is probably being misused. Check to make sure the changed version of it makes sense. </p>

<p id="nakedThisExplanation" class="hidden"> Add a noun after “this” to avoid any confusion about what you’re talking about. </p>

<p id="firstPersonExplanation" class="hidden"> First person should be avoided in formal essays. Think about taking out yourself and stating it as a fact. </p>

<p id="secondPersonExplanation" class="hidden"> Second person should be avoided in formal essays. Perhaps use “one” instead. </p>

<p id="contractionsExplanation" class="hidden"> Contractions should be avoided in formal essays. The full version of the word has been added. </p>

<p id="passiveVoiceExplanation" class="hidden"> Passive voice makes your writing less direct but can be useful when placing emphasis on the object/action or when the person performing the action is unknown. Check to make sure this use of passive voice has a purpose. </p>

<p id="repetitionExplanation" class="hidden"> You've used this word repeatedly - maybe try to change it up to avoid boring the reader. You've used this word <%=@repetitionCount%> times. </p>
